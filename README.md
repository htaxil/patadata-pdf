This repository hosts the compiled songbooks of [patadata](https://github.com/patacrep/patadata).

To force a new compilation, simply do a commit on the [`trigger`](https://github.com/patacrep/patadata-pdf/edit/trigger/trigger) branch, AppVeyor should do the rest: [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/hph8quqwprupi9gn/branch/trigger?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/oliverpool/patadata-pdf/branch/trigger)
